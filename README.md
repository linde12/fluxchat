# fluxchat

fluxchat is a simple example of how react and sockets could be used with flux(design pattern)

Some modules being used are
* node
* flux (lib from facebook)
* react
* socket.io
* jsxtransformer (for processing jsx in the browser)

You may also want to take a look at r.js to precompile your .jsx files with a build job.

The code is nothing special, i haven't put in much effort in writing beautiful code or doing much refactoring but i just wanted to give you a quick example of how flux could be used to keep your application in sync. It's pretty unneccesary for small applications(like this one) but if you know you're making a big project i would defenitely recommend trying flux.
